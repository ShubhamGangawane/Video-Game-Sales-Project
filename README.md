- With the Help of Essential Libraries like numpy , pandas , matplotlib and seaborn the steps that i took to find the conclusion.

- Pandas Methods which are used in these project-: *info(),desribe(),isna(),sum(),fillna() *value_counts(),groupby() *idxmax(),idxmin(), *unique()
- Graph which are used-: ->For plotting i have used matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn
        Bar graph
        Pie chart
        Countplot
        Lineplot
